.sp
The opslog program is designed to allow operators to take detailed notes
quickly and efficiently from the terminal without the need to open additional
programs or enter VM’s. Multiple operators can take notes on a single machine,
as each operator’s notes, are stored in separate logs, and the current operator
can be switched quickly without the need for restarting the terminal. Logs can
be exported in .csv format, allowing for easy import into any program that accepts
it (excel for example).
.sp
Log entries are created from the terminal from anywhere on the system
Each log entry contains a timestamp and the operators name, in addition to information
provided by the operator. Currently each log entry can hold the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
A pre\-approved action number
.IP \(bu 2
An ip address/range
.IP \(bu 2
Command syntax
.IP \(bu 2
Multiple flags used to tag entries
.IP \(bu 2
Notes by the operator about the action taken
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Using flags to tag log entries allows operators to later search through their
logs easily and display entries of interest or entries regarding particular
events.
.sp
Additionally, the program allows operators to log commands as they are run using
the command syntax field. The command input here can, if the operator chooses, be
executed after logging, giving a timestamped record of when commands were run on the
network.
.sp
Finally, multiple logs can be merged together. Merged logs are automatically sorted
properly based on time, allowing a operator to combine their logs from multiple
machines into one concise log or for multiple operators logs to be combined to
create an msl.

.SS Install Location
.sp
opslog is installed to the /usr/lib/ops_log/ directory.
The folder is created with root privileges and the sticky bit set.
This allows the program to access it’s configuration file and create
operator logs regardless which user is running it (after install, root
privileges are not required to run the program or create logs.)
.sp
Inside the ops_log/ folder are the config.ini file which the script
uses for tracking the current operator, and a operator_logs/ folder
which stores the .csv file logs for the operators. The operator_logs
folder is also created by root, with sticky bit permissions
to allow the program to update logs for operators even if they were initially
created while another user was logged in.

Once the initial installation is complete, the program can be run
from anywhere on the system using the shortcut alias ‘opslog’. If
for any reason this does not work and users are unable to use the
‘opslog’ shortcut after installation, users can create this alias
by adding the line:

This script is used to fill in operator notes automatically in .csv file format.
You can use this functions to simply input timestamped notes using the \-n option alone.
Commands input with the \-C option will be executed exactly as entered after logging.
Be careful to use single quote marks around commands or notes if they contain anything
that bash will try to interpret ($ or ! for example)

Once the logs are complete, they can be exported by using the \fBopslog \-\-export\fP command
and specifying the export location and optional format. The location can use absolute or relative path, and will
output to the current directory if only a filename is given

If for any reason multiple logs need to be combined, the \fBopslog \-\-merge\fP command can
do so. The command takes any number of files as arguments, checks these files to ensure they
are csv formated log files, and merges them together into one log.
